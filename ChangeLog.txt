  - spbuilder is a package builder for Slackware(c),
similar in intent to Debuntu's pbuilder application.
It uses Linux Containers (LXC) rather than chroot,
providing a completely sanitized environment for
building packages that include dependency information,
useful when using dependency-aware package installation
systems such as slapt-get.
