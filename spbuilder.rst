Slackware |reg| Package Builder
----------------------------------



Synopsis
========

::

	spbuilder create
	spbuilder update
	spbuilder build  <-s source | --source=source>
	spbuilder clean
	spbuilder login



Description
===========

*spbuilder* is the front end to a suite of commands,
somewhat modelled after Debuntu's Personal Builder (*pbuilder*) application.
Unlike pbuilder's chroot environment, *spbuilder* uses a
Linux Container (LXC) to provide the clean room environment
in which to build a Slackware package.

Commands
========

create
	generates a base container,
	from which *spbuilder* build containers are cloned.

update
	updates the base container to
	use the latest versions of included packages.

build
	clones a new *spbuilder* build container from the base
	container and builds a package specified by the --source option

clean
	cleans out files generated by *spbuilder* commmands
	but not files/directories which are part of the
	*spbuilder* package itself. This command is recommended
	prior to removal of the *spbuilder* package.

login
	starts up and attaches to the *spbuilder* base container
	to enable changes to be made.

Options
=======


--source=source
	This option only makes sense for the *build* command.
	It specifies the directory pair (section/name in an
	SBo directory tree), in which *spbuilder* will expect
	to find an appropriate SlackBuild script for the package.
-s source
	is the short form of the --source=source option.


Examples
========
spbuilder create
	Initialises *spbuilder* by generating the base *spbuilder* container.

spbuilder update
	Downloads and installs latest versions of any applications that
	are part of the base spbuilder container.

spbuilder build -s misc/mosquitto
	Build the mosquitto package found in the misc section
	of an SBo slackbuilds tree. The location of the slackbuilds
	tree is set by the SPBUILDER_SLACKBUILDS environment variable; it
	is set in /etc/spbuilder/spbuilderrc.
	The resulting package will be found in /var/cache/spbuilder/result/.

spbuilder build --source=misc/mosquitto
	Equivalent to spbuilder build -s misc/mosquitto


Files
=====
/var/cache/spbuilder - directory in which spbuilder's base tarball,
build and result directories are located.

/var/cache/lxc/spbuilder - directory used by the LXC template to
store downloaded packages and initial build of a new container

/usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-spbuilder-1402 - LXC template for
spbuilder's base tarball.


Environment
===========
SPBUILDER_BASE
	Directory for spbuilder files and directories
	(defaults to /var/cache/spbuilder). It is set in
	/etc/spbuilder/spbuilderrc

SPBUILDER_SLACKBUILDS
	Directory wher an SBo slackbuilds directory tree can be found
	(defaults to /scratch/PKG/SBo/slackbuilds). It is set in
	/etc/spbuilder/spbuilderrc
